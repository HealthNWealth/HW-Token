**Brief Introduction to the HW project**:

The HealthNWealth (HW) Project aims to reward users for their physical activities and
fitness exercises. The Project manufactures, markets, and sells its own smartwatch and smart
ring products. These two smart devices measure and record a user’s physical activity, like the
HEALTH application in Apple’s iOS.
HealthNWealth will constitute a protocol that runs on the BNB chain (former BSC chain)
and the HW token is a true cryptocurrency that will have an actual value on the blockchain.
This means that the users will be rewarded with actual money in return for their physical
activities.
Physical activity data consists of steps, heart pulse, oxygen levels, and oxygen saturation
levels. Rewards for physical activity will be in HW tokens. HealthNWealth users will earn HW
tokens at a physical activity rate of:

• 40 tokens per one second of light activity.

• 100 tokens per one second of moderate activity.

• 200 tokens per one second of intense activity.

Light activity includes activities like walking, yoga, and pilates, while moderate activity
includes jogging or light running, and intense activity includes ball games, kickboxing, running,
aerobics, etc.
Reward tokens will be distributed monthly. Users will receive their reward tokens to their
registered wallets at the end of every month. BNB network fees will be covered by the Project
Team. The Team will always have enough BNB coins for network fees in a designated wallet to
be able to send the reward tokens to user wallets.

The rate of reward token distribution will halve for all three physical activity categories
(light, medium, heavy) at every 30 billion HW tokens distributed to users. The purpose is to
increase the lifecycle of reward token distribution as much as possible while incentivizing early
users with the maximum dollar amount value for their tokens.

Assuming that the median user performs moderate activity (100 HW tokens per second)
for an average of one hour per day, he/she would earn a total of approximately 130 million
HW tokens per year. At that rate, it would take around 250 users (rounding up) to reach the
first 30 billion token cap by the end of the first year. The Team expects to reach a total of
approximately 120,000 users by the end of the tenth halving when all 300 billion tokens for the
ecosystem are distributed.

The team will develop and execute the necessary code that halves the rewards automatically
at every 30 billion HW token distribution to wallets.
